# JavaSynth

JavaSynth is a small webpage built for the [University of Lethbridge](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/)'s Web Design and Development course. It features 3 sets of regular note keyboards, each producing a unique waveform that plays on click. The output sound can be modulated by dragging the mouse up and down on the page.

## A word of warning (regarding GitHub pages)

Like my [previous assignment](https://frontiercorps.neocities.org/), I want to spend a bit of time to go over some of the development of this project. The problem is there isn't much to say. I think the most interesting bit would be mentioning [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) as it prevented me from having to drown myself in the [Web Audio API docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

No, the real reason why I'm writing this is because of GitHub Pages. I figured that it would be more convienent for hosting this project than [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), as I wouldn't have to worry about creating a brand new account for a single webpage. What I didn't anticipate is that the root URL would be my GitHub username. I don't know for sure, nor do I have the time to check, but I think that also serves as the root for your Page site. What does this mean? Well, it means if you tried to follow good practices like always referring to the root of your site (`/`), you're going to find that the whole website breaks. Have fun removing slashes and adding dots (`../`) to restore functionality! Consider this my excuse for 3 ditto commits all serving the same purpose.
