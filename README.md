# JavaSynth

JavaSynth is a small webpage built for the [University of Lethbridge](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/)'s Web Design and Development course. It features 3 sets of regular note keyboards, each producing a unique waveform that plays on click. The output sound can be modulated by dragging the mouse up and down on the page.
